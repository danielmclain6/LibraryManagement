------------all routes---------

Get Routes
	all get routes need to render a jsp file 
	all get routes need to check HttpSession ad pass the additinal model "userId" and "isLibrarian" for permission notices
	if web user tries to access url routes that they shouldn't be, check session and reroute them to books or landing page

	localhost:/
	localhost:/login	
      * localhost:/books?which_filter=all  or ?which_filter=only_in_library  or ?which_filter=all_currenly_checkedout
      * localhost:/book?isbn=0	
	localhost:/patrons
	localhost:/patron?id=0   - make a way for patron to see they own page and their own page only

* on the localhost:/books and localhost:/book?isbn=0 url 
  we are going to have a modle that will create a new book and edit the current books
